            <p>
              We believe transportation and logistics are more than moving
              freight from one destination to another. Itâ€™s a process built on
              standards, professionalism, performance and metrics. With this
              foundation, we strive to minimize obstacles in order to deliver
              immediate results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our efforts have earned us a reputation for driving greater
              operational efficiency and enhancing shareholder value.

            <p class="white">
              We strive to reduce our carbon footprint through the purchase and
              use of the most up-to-date technologies available in the
              marketplace.

              Our fleet is typically equipped with the latest in fuel economy,
              safety and aerodynamics, allowing vehicles to operate more
              efficiently. Most new equipment is ordered with Eco Options and/or
              Green House Gas (GHG) emission lowering options, which can result
              in significant potential fuel savings over previous equipment
              designs.

              To eliminate the potential risk of environmental contamination, we
              remove in-ground fuel and diesel tanks across our network in North
              America. When appropriate, we install new above ground fuel tanks
              with current engineering construction standards. This ensures
              maximum safety for the operator and protects the environment from
              potential spills.

            <h6 class="white">ENERGY CONSERVATION</h6>

              In 2017, we initiated an intense review of our lighting systems in

              wherever possible.
            </p>
            <p class="white">
              We also reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling by
              installing clean systems and electronic or programmable
              thermostats. In addition, we conduct annual inspections to
              recognize and address any low performance areas.
