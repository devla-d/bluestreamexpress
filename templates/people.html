                <h6>Alain Bedard, FCPA</h6>
                <p>Chairman of the Board, President and CEO</p>
                <div class="info" style="display: none">
                  <p>
                    A graduate in Accounting and Finance from the
                    <em>Université de Sherbrooke</em>, Mr. Bédard began his
                    career at KPMG in 1975. He rose to become a senior auditor
                    within three years while obtaining his CA and CMA
                    designations. Subsequently he served as a Controller in the
                    forest products sector before joining Saputo in 1984 where
                    he progressed through the ranks to become its Vice-President
                    Finance. In 1996, he assumed management of a regional
                    trucking firm which eventually became {{domain}}.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From the outset, Mr. Bédard introduced a bold strategic plan
                    of expansion, based on specific criteria including
                    profitability, market penetration and geographic expansion.
                    He has built a strong management team and has empowered them
                    to ensure the Corporate philosophy of decentralization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Through a series of acquisitions and strategic investments
                    across Canada and the U.S., Mr. Bédard has created a
                    powerful, diversified trucking and logistics network. TFI
                    International continually studies acquisition opportunities
                    to further strengthen its network.<br />
                    <br />
                    The creation of shareholder value is an on-going focus and
                    is a key priority for Mr. Bédard.<br />
                    <br />
                    Mr. Bédard’s community activities include participation in a
                    range of humanitarian causes and support for foundations
                    active in health and higher education. Mr. Bédard was
                    awarded the title of Fellow by the Quebec FCPA Order in
                    February 2011.
